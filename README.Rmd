## README

This file describes the steps taken to tidy a data and a code book is given along in the repository.

## Steps taken to reach the tidy data:

1.  Download and extract the .zip file.
2.  Read test, train, activity and features data into an R script file denoted by     run_analysis
3.  Merge the test and train data and create a data frame.
4.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each       measurement.
5.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
7.  Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
